# Project Title

Bioinformatics-misc.

## Description

A collection of bioinformatics exercises and scripts done as part of Biol 668 in Spring 2025.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Linux/Unix-based operating system (e.g., Ubuntu, macOS)

R (for R-based scripts)

QIIME 2 (for microbiome analysis)

Bioconductor libraries (e.g., limma, edgeR, Glimma)

Seurat package (for single-cell RNA-seq analysis)

### Installing

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bioinformatics-misc.git
Navigate to the project directory: cd bioinformatics-misc
Make the script files executable: chmod +x *.sh

### Executing program

For R-based notebooks (e.g., RNA-Seq or single-cell analysis)
Open the notebook in RStudio or Jupyter and run the code chunks.

For QIIME 2-based analysis (microbiome analysis)
Follow the steps within the QIIME 2 tutorial by running commands in the terminal:
